            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies to Surmount Creative Agency ("Surmount", "we", "us", or "our"), and governs
                the use and sharing of personal information that we collect from individuals who visit our website or

                <br><br>
                <b>How We Use Your Information</b>
                <br><br>
                We use the information we collect to provide and improve our services, to communicate with you about our
                services and promotions, and to comply with legal obligations.
                <br><br>
                We may also share your information with third-party service providers who assist us with our business
                operations, such as payment processing and email marketing. These service providers are bound by
                confidentiality agreements and are not authorized to use your information for any other purpose.
                <br><br>
                We may also disclose your information in response to a court order or other legal obligation, or if we
                believe such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our clients
                or others.
                <br><br>
                <b>Your Rights</b>

                <b> Security</b>
                <br><br>
                We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
                or misuse. However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we
                cannot guarantee the security of your information.

                continuing to use our services after any changes to this Privacy Policy, you agree to be bound by the
                updated policy.
